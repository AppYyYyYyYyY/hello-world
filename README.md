Hello, my name is Alfie Appleyard. I am 19 years old and I am currentlty studying Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at Leeds Beckett University. I enjoy staying physically active through activities such as:
Staying consistent in the gym, playing and practicing golf and also playing football. I also am interested in the financial aspects of the world and intruiged by current world events and how these affect and shape the current and future economy both worldwide and also specifically in the United Kinddom In my part-time I day trade on my laptop at home and I am eager to hone this skill and gradually improve on this and my current mindset and approach to this.
